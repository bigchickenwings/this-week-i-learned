Gem [simplecov](https://github.com/simplecov-ruby/simplecov)

This gem allows you to check the perentage of your test coverage! It's also super easy to use after you have installed following [their setup](https://github.com/simplecov-ruby/simplecov#getting-started).

You just run your tests normally and then open the `coverage/index.html` on your browser.
If you're on MacOS, just type:

```
open coverage/index.html
```
