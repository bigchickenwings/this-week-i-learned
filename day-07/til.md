Source Location

In ruby we can use a method called `source_location`, that allows us to easily locate the source location of the method. Super convenient!

In this example thought, it might look a little bit silly, as we know where the method is and we even `require` it manually, but in a real Rails/Gems scenario, where most of the "magic" happens behind the curtains, it can save us a lot of time!
